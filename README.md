# Daily Huddle

Simple and configurable tool to manage daily huddles in a remote team.

## What's this?

This repo has been developed as an internal tool to manage daily huddles.

A huddle can be configured to have a set of members and a set of time blocks. When the huddle starts, it will go through each member and each time block until it finishes.

Some extra configuration options have been added so each huddle can be customised per team or organisation. This includes things like some basic texts and theming options.

This is a client-side only application and no data leaves your browser. All configuration is stored as URL query parameters so huddles can be easily shared or stored as bookmarks.
