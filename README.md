# Daily Huddle

Simple and configurable tool to manage daily huddles in a remote team.

See [working version](https://daily.origen.studio).

## What's this?

This repo has been developed as an internal tool to manage daily huddles.

A huddle can be configured to have a set of members and a set of time blocks. When the huddle starts, it will go through each member and each time block until it finishes.

Some extra configuration options have been added so each huddle can be customised per team or organisation. This includes things like some basic texts and theming options.

This is a client-side only application and no data leaves your browser. All configuration is stored as URL query parameters so huddles can be easily shared or stored as bookmarks.

## Can I use it?

Yes! Please feel free to use it on [our site](https://daily.origen.studio) to manage your daily huddles. You can customise some theming so it feels more branded, but feel free to fork, clone and/or redeploy it.

## Disclaimer

This is still an early version and we may do breaking changes at some point, so bear in mind that shared or bookmarked links may stop working. We are sorry for the inconvenience, we will try to do it as least as possible and always for a good reason.
